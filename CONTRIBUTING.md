Contributing
============

The main way to contribute is testing. If you find a bug please post an issue on github.

You might want to suggest new functionality by posting a github issue.

Pull Requests
-------------

Before you do any modification of penumbra please post an issue about what you would like to change.

Any bug fixes will probably be ok'd right away.

Minor changes to functionality that are not breaking will also be accepted quickly.

Any major modifications to functionality should be postponed for a week, or two just in case someone objects to the change. Depending on how major a change might be postponed longer.

To minimize conflicts if the major change you want to do is accepted all other pull requests (other than your own) will be rejected until you have made the change, and made the pull request.

Super major changes, or breaking changes should be postponed, and considered for the next major version. Once your super major change has been accepted this repo maintainer reserves the right to take your idea, and implement it without you if you take to long. :)

Make your own
-------------

If you like penumbra, but have some problems with it. Fork it, rename it, and make it your own.

Post an issue on the penumbra repo with all your complaints. Implement your ideal style in your fork of penumbra.

In the future maybe we can merge the projects if you can prove you have the better, more novel, efficient, or cooler idea.
